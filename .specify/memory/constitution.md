# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy
All content must be technically accurate and structured pedagogically for undergraduate to early graduate students

### Academic Writing Standards
Style must be clear, academic, and beginner-friendly with diagrams (ASCII or Mermaid when helpful), examples, and summaries; avoid unnecessary jargon

### Technical Standards Compliance
Book Framework must use Docusaurus, Language must be Markdown + MDX, and Deployment must use GitHub Pages

### AI Specification Adherence
Claude must follow specifications strictly, no hallucinated citations, clarify ambiguous robotics concepts, and prefer structured explanations over prose

### RAG & Chatbot Content Integrity
Chatbot must answer ONLY from book content and support both full-book queries and selected-text-only queries using embeddings + vector search

### Specification-Driven Development
All development must follow specification-driven methodology with clear requirements before implementation

## Pedagogical Standards
Content must be structured for university-level education with clear learning objectives, examples, and summaries for each major section

## Development Workflow
All content development must follow the specification-driven approach with clear requirements, architectural planning, and testable tasks

## Governance
All development must comply with these principles; amendments require documentation and approval; all changes must maintain educational quality and technical accuracy
