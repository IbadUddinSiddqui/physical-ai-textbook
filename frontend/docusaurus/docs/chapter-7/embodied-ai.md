# Embodied AI

## Introduction to Embodied AI

Embodied AI is the field that studies intelligence in physical agents that interact with the real world. Unlike traditional AI that operates on abstract data, embodied AI emphasizes the role of physical interaction in developing and expressing intelligence.

## The Embodiment Hypothesis

### Core Principles
- Intelligence emerges from interaction with the environment
- The body shapes cognition and learning
- Physical constraints drive efficient solutions
- Embodiment provides natural regularization

### Theoretical Foundations
- Enactivism and embodied cognition
- Sensorimotor contingencies
- Extended mind thesis
- Morphological computation

## Embodied vs. Traditional AI

### Key Differences
- **Interaction**: Real-world vs. simulated environments
- **Learning**: Through physical experience vs. abstract data
- **Representation**: Grounded in sensorimotor experience vs. symbolic
- **Adaptation**: Continuous environmental adaptation vs. static models

### Advantages of Embodied AI
- Natural grounding of concepts
- Robustness to environmental changes
- Emergence of complex behaviors
- Energy-efficient computation
